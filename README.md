# CNN-Acclerator
A CNN accelerator is a specialized hardware module designed to speed up the computation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in image processing, computer vision, and AI tasks. It performs operations like convolution, activation (e.g., ReLU), pooling computations more efficiently than general-purpose processors.
Typically implemented on FPGAs, ASICs, or GPUs, a CNN accelerator leverages parallelism, pipelining, and data reuse techniques to reduce latency, power consumption, and memory bandwidth requirements. This makes it ideal for real-time AI applications in embedded systems, mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, and edge computing.
