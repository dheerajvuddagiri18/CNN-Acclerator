# CNN-Acclerator
A CNN accelerator is a specialized hardware module designed to speed up the computation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used in image processing, computer vision, and AI tasks. It performs operations like convolution, activation (e.g., ReLU), pooling computations more efficiently than general-purpose processors.
